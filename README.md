Basic web design, with some css styles and Javascript functions


1.       Tell us about a project you've worked on in the past that you're proud of. What technologies did you use, and what was your role in the project?

 
 I worked on a website for one of my classes and I based it on one of my favorite games Factorio.  I used Visual Studio 2019 with a .NET framework and implemented a database as well.  I was the sole developer on this project, so I was doing a Full Stack Project.  I did everything from the front end designing the page to the backend with all the coding.
 

2.       What is the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Can you give a brief overview of their roles in web development?

 
 HTML is basically the skeleton of a website.  It holds everything together as a structure.  CSS adds any kind of style and formatting to a website, like with colors, images, and fonts.  Javascript does many things but it's mainly used to turn some components of the website into effects or to interact with the user.  Javascript is very dynamic and can do a lot.
 

3.       Can you explain the concept of responsive web design? Why is it important, and how can you achieve it using HTML and CSS?

 
 Responsive web design is the concept of adapting your website to look good and presentable on all devices.  It ensures that your website will automatically detect the device the user is using and adjust the page to format to that screen size.  Maintaining responsive web design is mainly achieved through formatting your page's elements using CSS.  You can adjust this in HTML as well.
 

4.       What are some best practices for writing clean and maintainable code? How do you ensure your code is easy to understand and modify?

 
 I was taught that using less code is better, but it all depends on what you're doing.  It could be the shortest code ever but if it runs inefficiently, that's not very clean code.  It's a balancing act of writing enough code to accomplish what you need and be as efficient as you can with it.  Checking your documentation for whatever code you're writing in is beneficial as well.  You can also use Validation services like W3C to check your markup validity.
 

5.       Explain the three main principles (pillars) of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and provide a brief example of each.

 
 The three main principles of Object-Oriented Programming is encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  Encapsulation is about defining an object with features and behaviors, but hiding some parts of it from other objects if they don't need to know about them or not.  If they need some information on that object, show it;  Otherwise hide it.  Inheritance is all about defining an object that can be used to define other similar objects.  For example.  We can define a vehicle.  That object can make child objects based on the type of vehicle and those can inherit traits from vehicle.  We have car, bike, and truck objects that have inherited from the vehicle parent object.  Finally we have Polymorphism, the hard one.  It essentially means that we can treat an object diffrently based on how and when we need it.  It basically changes itself based on when we use it.
 

6.       How do you approach problem-solving and debugging when you encounter an issue in your code? Can you provide an example of a time you had to troubleshoot a problem?

 
 I typically look at the error that has occured and decide from there what to do.  If the error code doesn't tell me enough I might Google search the error code and see what comes up.  Sometimes that helps, sometimes it doesn't.  Whenever I'm coding in Javascript I'll typically debug using console.logs to track what's changing in the function I'm using.
 

7.       How do you stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies? Are there any resources or communities you follow?

 
 Whenever I do code in my personal time I'll usually just hear about anything updating in the news or I might see it if I need to check their documentation for something.
 

8.       Can you explain the difference between "GET" and "POST" methods in HTTP requests? Provide an example of when you would use each method.

 
 GET methods request data from a source and POST methods submit the data to a source.  GET methods can be used to get some information from the user like login information.  POST methods can be used to verify that the login information is correct and change the page to the user's home page or deny if the login information is incorrect.
 

9.       What is version control, and why is it important in software development? Are you familiar with any version control systems, such as Git?

 
 Version control is mainly used to work on existing projects and verify certain changes to a newer version compared to the previous.  It's useful in case a new feature breaks something not caught in testing beforehand, so the version can either be rolled back or fixed in the coming versions.  I use Github for version control.
 

10.   How do you work in a team environment, especially when collaborating with other developers? Can you provide an example of a time you worked with others on a project?

 
 I work well with others collaboratively on projects.  We usually bounce ideas off each other and decide on what needs to be implemented mainly to get the project finished and any ideas that would be good to add but aren't as important to the functionality.  I've worked on two group projects one with 3 others and one with 2 others.  First project we worked on a website about dogs and second project we made a text based adventure game.
 

11.   What motivates you to pursue a career in web and software development? What do you hope to achieve in this position at our company?

 
 I really like working on projects and developing and I wanted to make a career out of it.  Computers and technology always interested me and I'm not into mechanical engineering as much but I enjoyed the programming side.  So I figured learning software development would be the place to be.
